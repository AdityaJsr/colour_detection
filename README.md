# colour_detection
Nothing like moving out of basics of a programming language and working on a real project.
This is a python project where i have tried to create a color detector using packages like pandas,openCV,numpy for better understand and useage.

the project uses argparse so that we can asign the image directory
command to run the code

> python color_detection.py -i image directory --i image name and extention
eg
> python color_detection.py -i C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe --i image.jpg
